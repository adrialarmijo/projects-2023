# projects-2023

projects-2023 contains a javascript application that allows the user to make a to-do list using containerization from Docker

## Installation

Install Docker Desktop and pull my image from my Docker Hub repository. Note, this was built using Macbook M1 settings, 
so things are slightly different for Linux and Windows Powershell users.

```bash
docker pull aarmijo23/git-projects:latest
```

## How to run

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## How to shut down

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Usage

Run the application and then load web browser to //localhost:3000
Add items to the list

## Project Goals

I am starting off with the docker to-do list tutorial and building on top of it.
I plan to implement more app security, a better user experience, and additional features.
